Chat App

Description

This Chat App is a full stack real time messaging platform built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) and Socket.IO for live communication. It allows users to register, log in securely, and send instant messages in real time. The app supports 1 on 1 private chats, real time message delivery, and a clean, responsive user interface.

This project demonstrates my proficiency in developing real time web applications, handling WebSocket communication, and integrating client-server architecture. It features secure user authentication, persistent chat storage in MongoDB, and seamless user experience through efficient front-end and back-end coordination.
